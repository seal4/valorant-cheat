# Likelyhood of getting banned?
out of 5 games of unrated I am yet to be banned. this script does not touch the games memory or alter any games files at all, that being said vaguard is a very invasive anticheat that could update at any moment and ban this script. although I highly doubt you will ever get banned due to the nature of this script
